					<h3>Topkapi Palace</h3>
					<p>The Topkapı Palace, or the Seraglio, is a large museum in the east of the Fatih district of Istanbul in Turkey. In the 15th and 16th centuries it served as the main residence and administrative headquarters of the Ottoman sultans. Construction, ordered by the Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror, began in 1459, six years after the conquest of Constantinople. Topkapı was originally called the "New Palace" to distinguish it from the Old Palace in Beyazıt Square. It was given the name Topkapı, meaning Cannon Gate, in the 19th century. The complex expanded over the centuries, with major renovations after the 1509 earthquake and the 1665 fire. The palace complex consists of four main courtyards and many smaller buildings. Female members of the Sultan's family lived in the harem, and leading state officials, including the Grand Vizier, held meetings in the Imperial Council building. After the 17th century, Topkapı gradually lost its importance. The sultans of that period preferred to spend more time in their new palaces along the Bosphorus. In 1856 Sultan Abdulmejid I decided to move the court to the newly built Dolmabahçe Palace.</p>

					<h3>Pamukkale</h3>
					<p>Pamukkale, meaning "cotton castle" in Turkish, is a natural site in Denizli in southwestern Turkey. The area is famous for a carbonate mineral left by the flowing water. It is located in Turkey's Inner Aegean region, in the River Menderes valley, which has a temperate climate for most of the year. The ancient Greco-Roman city of Hierapolis was built on top of the white "castle" which is in total about 2,700 metres long, 600 m wide and 160 m high. It can be seen from the hills on the opposite side of the valley in the town of Denizli, 20 km away. Known as Pamukkale or ancient Hierapolis, this area has been drawing the weary to its thermal springs since the time of Classical antiquity. The Turkish name refers to the surface of the shimmering, snow-white limestone, shaped over millennia by calcium-rich springs. Dripping slowly down the vast mountainside, mineral-rich waters foam and collect in terraces, spilling over cascades of stalactites into milky pools below. Legend has it that the formations are solidified cotton that giants left out to dry. Tourism is and has been a major industry in the area for thousands of years, due to the attraction of the thermal pools.</p>

					<h3>Hagia Sophia Museum</h3>
					<p>Hagia Sophia is the former Greek Orthodox Christian patriarchal cathedral, later an Ottoman imperial mosque and now a museum in Istanbul, Turkey. Built in AD 537 in the Middle Ages, it was famous in particular for its massive dome. It was the world's largest building and an engineering marvel of its time. It is considered the epitome of Byzantine architecture and is said to have "changed the history of architecture". The Hagia Sophia construction consists of mostly masonry. The structure is composed of brick and mortar joints that are 1.5 times the width of the bricks. The mortar joints are composed of a combination of sand and minute ceramic pieces displaced very evenly throughout the mortar joints. This combination of sand and ceramic pieces could be considered to be the equivalent of modern concrete at the time. From the date of its construction's completion in 537 until 1453, it served as an Eastern Orthodox cathedral and the seat of the ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople, except between 1204 and 1261, when it was converted by the Fourth Crusaders to a Roman Catholic cathedral under the Latin Empire.</p>

					<h3>Grand Bazaar</h3>
					<p>The Grand Bazaar in Istanbul is one of the largest and oldest covered markets in the world, with 61 covered streets and over 4,000 shops on a total area of 30,700 m², attracting between 250,000 and 400,000 visitors daily. In 2014, it was listed No.1 among the world's most-visited tourist attractions with 91,250,000 annual visitors. The Grand Bazaar at Istanbul is often regarded as one of the first shopping malls of the world. </p>

					<h3>Celsus Library, Ephesus</h3>
					<p>The Library of Celsus is an ancient Roman building in Ephesus, Anatolia, now part of Selçuk, Turkey. The building was commissioned in the 110s A.D. by a consul, Gaius Julius Aquila, as a funerary monument for his father, former proconsul of Asia Tiberius Julius Celsus Polemaeanus, and completed during the reign of Hadrian, sometime after Aquila's death. The library is considered an architectural marvel, and is one of the only remaining examples of a library from the Roman Empire. The Library of Celsus was the third-largest library in the Roman world behind only Alexandria and Pergamum, believed to have held around twelve thousand scrolls. Celsus is buried in a crypt beneath the library in a decorated marble sarcophagus. The interior of the library and its contents were destroyed in a fire that resulted either from an earthquake or a Gothic invasion in 262 C.E, and the façade by an earthquake in the tenth or eleventh century. It lay in ruins for centuries until the façade was re-erected by archaeologists between 1970 and 1978.</p>

					<h3>Mount Nemrut</h3>
					<p>Crowning one of the highest peaks of the Eastern Taurus mountain range in south-east Turkey, Nemrut Dağ is the Hierotheseion (temple-tomb and house of the gods) built by the late Hellenistic King Antiochos I of Commagene (69-34 B.C.) as a monument to himself.
                       With a diameter of 145 m, the 50 m high funerary mound of stone chips is surrounded on three sides by terraces to the east, west and north directions. Two separate antique processional routes radiate from the east and west terraces. Five giant seated limestone statues, identified by their inscriptions as deities, face outwards from the tumulus on the upper level of the east and west terraces. These are flanked by a pair of guardian animal statues – a lion and eagle – at each end. The heads of the statues have fallen off to the lower level, which accommodates two rows of sandstone stelae, mounted on pedestals with an altar in front of each stele. One row carries relief sculptures of Antiochos’ paternal Persian ancestors, the other of his maternal Macedonian ancestors. Inscriptions on the backs of the stelae record the genealogical links. A square altar platform is located at the east side of the east terrace. On the west terrace there is an additional row of stelae representing the particular significance of Nemrut, the handshake scenes (dexiosis) showing Antiochos shaking hands with a deity and the stele with a lion horoscope, believed to be indicating the construction date of the cult area. The north terrace is long, narrow and rectangular in shape, and hosts a series of sandstone pedestals. The stelae lying near the pedestals on the north terrace have no reliefs or inscriptions.</p>

				<h2>Traveling tips</h2>
				<article>
					<h3>Study History</h3>
					<p>To travel through Turkey without knowing the history would be like driving without GPS. One of the oldest regions in the world, Turkey has a rich historical story, and you must understand a few chapters in order to truly appreciate it.
                       A quick primer to get you started: The Seljuks, the Mongols, and the Ottomans played a huge role in shaping the nation's history. After the Ottoman empire fell into decline in the 1800s, Turkey fought for independence and sovereignty. Mustafa Kemal Atatürk became the founder and first President of Turkey in 1923, a key historical moment in Turkey’s identity. Ataturk is the reason for many of Turkey’s modern facets today, including education, political structure, art, and culture. Also, a total of eight countries border Turkey, and there is a fascinating history of Kurdish, Syrian, and Jewish communities and their unique experiences in Turkey.</p>

					<h3>Carry Cash in Different Currencies</h3>
					<p>The easiest currencies to convert into Turkish Lira are US Dollars and Euro. Change offices offer the best rates. There are many ATMs throughout Turkey, but don't solely rely on your ATM card as your main source of cash in the event that you cannot find a machine that accepts your card.
                       Always have a mixture of cash (in small denominations), an ATM card and a credit card available. Traveler's checks are not recommended, as most stores won't accept them and banks and post offices with very long queues are the only places to cash them in.</p>

				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>What sort of plugs do I need for Turkey and what is the voltage?</h3>
					<p>Standard voltage is 230 - 240 volts. Primary sockets generally require the 3 round-pin variety, similar though not identical to European sockets. Greek sockets are of the 2 round-pin variety. We recommend that you pack a universal travel adaptor. You will need a voltage converter and plug adaptor in order to use U.S. appliances.</p>
					<img src="images/Turkey/voltage.jpg" width="1000px">
				</article>
				<br><br>
				<article>
					<h3>Best Season</h3>
					<p>Because Turkey experiences hot summers and cold winters, the spring and fall seasons (April, May, and mid-September through mid-November) are the best time to visit. During these times, the skies are likely to be sunny and temperatures pleasant, it’s unlikely to be too crowded, and visitors also have a better chance at discounted airfare and accommodation.</p>
					<p><b>Summer</b> can be extremely hot, hitting 100 F (38F) but still a lot of fun to go as long as you prepare adequately for the heat. Bring UV umbrellas, sunscreen, and drink plenty of water. But there will be certain places, that feel unbearable between 12 PM and 5 PM in peak summertime such as Ephesus and Cappadocia.</p>
					<p><b>Winter</b> can be cold with snow in certain parts. The tourism low season is November through March.</p>
					<p><b>Spring</b> is gorgeous as everything is in full bloom and it’s not yet as hot. This is considered their high peak season (April & May).</p>
					<p><b>Fall</b> is also a great time to go, but it’s also a high peak season (September & October). The weather is temperate during most of Turkey around this time.</p>
