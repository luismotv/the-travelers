                <h3>Batanes</h3>
                <p>This beautiful, small island is located in Cagayan Valley, the northermost region of the country. Batanes is also least populated, so anyone who is up for a ‘quiet’ vacation will definitely love this place.</p>
                <p>Batanes is the north beyond the north of the Philippines, and can sometimes be difficult to reach if the weather is not permissive. A large part of the beauty of Batanes is due to its people, the Ivatans. Their stone houses are one of
                    the must-sees, at the very least for the ingenuity of the architecture. Our host explains that building a house for the Ivatans has been a tradition inclusive of everyone in the community they come together, each bringing materials,
                    and work non-stop until the house is made.</div>

                <p>Mount Apo stands more than 9,000 ft. above sea level; thus, making it the highest mountain in the Philippines. Mountain climbers will surely be in awe of the view from the top, which overlooks Digos and Kidapawan City.<br>

                <h3>Lechon</h3>
                <p>Lechon is a broad term that refers to a suckling pig that has been seasoned, skewered on a bamboo pole, and roasted whole over charcoal. It is particularly famous on the island of Cebu and you’ll see lots of shops along the roads with
                    whole roast pigs in the window. On his trip to the Philippines Anthony Boudain asserted that the lechon on Cebu Island was "the best pig ever!"</p>
                <div>Just as there are many ways to prepare pork (and many different cuts of meat) there are plenty of ways to prepare and serve lechon after it has finished roasting. It can be eaten right off of the carcass with a side of sinangag (garlic
                    fried rice) or the leftovers can be added to dishes like sinigang or paksiw na lechon. Our favorite was lechon kawali which is crispy fried pork belly served with two dipping sauces: toyomansî (a spicy sweet combination of soy sauce,
                    calamansi juice, and diced chili peppers) and mang tomas (made from ground up pork liver).</div>

                <h3>Sisig</h3>
                <p>You’ll know someone has ordered sisig when you hear the sizzling and see the steam rising off of the cast-iron skillet. It’s like Filipino fajitas and is an extremely popular dish in the Philippines! Pork sisig is most common and it consists
                    of chopped up pig ears, jowls and liver, onion, and chili peppers delivered on a sizzling hot skillet with a raw egg on top. You’ll need to mix in the egg to cook it before the skillet cools down. It usually comes with a couple calamansi
                    halves so you can squeeze the juice over the top. Other versions of sisig include pork belly, chicken, tuna, eggplant, and pretty much anything else you can put on a sizzling hot plate.</p>

                <h3>Halo-Halo</h3>
                <p>Literally meaning "mix mix" the name halo-halo is a pretty apt description for this traditional Filipino dessert that includes every sweet treat the restaurant has in their refrigerator and freezer. The main ingredients of halo-halo are
                    shaved ice, ice cream, and condensed milk. It could also include fruits such as lychee or mango, sweetened red beans, jellies, corn flakes, and coconut strings, just to name a few. It’s served in a clear glass so you can see all of
                    the layered ingredients, and it’s up to you to mix it all up into a sugary delicious mess. Enjoy!</p>

                <h3>Visa Requirements</h3>
                <p>Nationals from 151 countries may enter the Philippines without a visa and stay for a maximum of thirty (30) days, provided they are holders of a passport valid at least six (6) months beyond the period of stay in the Philippines, and present
                    a return or outward bound ticket to their country of origin or to your next country of destination (They are quite strict with showing an outbound ticket so plan accordingly). Brazilian and Israeli nationals are given fifty-nine (59)
                    days stay based on existing agreements.</p>

                <div>Some nationalities can only stay for 7-14 days so it is best to check the government website beforehand. If you plan on staying for longer than 30 days, you can apply for a visa waiver first, granting an additional stay of twenty-nine
                    (29) in the Philippines.</div><br>

                <h3>Transportation</h3>
                <p>The transport from one place to the next is can be a mission due to it being an archipelago. If you have limited time, flying from one island to the next is essential. We recommend downloading the Skyscanner App and using the 12Go website
                    to view bus, boat, and train schedules ahead of time. Bookaway also allows you to book buses from Manila to Banawe, Sagada, Batangas and more.</p>
                <p>While you can visit the Philippines all year round, it is generally better to avoid the wet or rainy season. Although with the exception of big typhoons, during the wet season, days are more likely to be hot with short rain showers in
                    the afternoon so it isn’t entirely too bad. In a nutshell, the weather in the Philippines can be broken down into two parts. The dry season (January-May) and wet season (June-December).</p>
                <div><em>The most popular mode of public transportation in the Philippines is known as the jeepney.</em></div>

                <h3>Rough Budget</h3>
                <p>Although it is still considered cheap, compared to other Southeast Asian countries, the Philippines is still slightly more expensive with accommodation usually being the biggest expense. A comfortable budget would be around $35-40 a day,
                    depending on your travel style. Because most of the places around the Philippines is spread out (it is an archipelago, after all) most people end up spending a lot on transportation as well. If you have more time and you don’t mind
                    traveling slow, you can definitely stretch your budget a bit more. Here’s an estimate of rough costs on traveling the Philippines.</p>

                <h3>Ati-Atihan Festival</h3>
                <p>The Ati-Atihan Festival is a feast held annually in January in honor of the Santo Niño (Infant Jesus), Held on the third Sunday, in the town of Kalibo Philippines in the island of Panay originally came from Batan, Aklan, then adopted later
                    by some neighboring towns. The name Ati-Atihan means "to be like Atis" or "to make believe Atis", the local name for the Aeta aborigines who first settled in Panay Island and other parts of the archipelago. The festival consists of
                    tribal dance, music, accompanied by indigenous costumes and weapons, and parade along the street. Christians and non-Christians observe this day with religious processions. It has inspired many other Philippine Festivals including
                    the Sinulog Festival of Cebu and Dinagyang of Iloilo City, both adaptations of the Kalibo's Ati-Atihan Festival, and legally holds the title "The Mother of All Philippine Festivals" in spite of the other two festivals' claims of the
                    same title. The costumes worn at the festival is patterned after the African tribal design like those seen at the Rio Carnaval. </p><br>

                <h3>Masskara Festival</h3>
                <p>The term Masskara is coined from two words: mass, meaning crowd, and the Spanish word cara, for face; thus the double meaning for "mask" and "many faces". The Masskara festival was first conceived in 1980 to add color and gaiety to the
                    Bcolod City's celebration of its Charter Day anniversary, on 19 October. The symbol of the festival - a smiling mask - was adopted by the organizers to dramatize the Negrenses happy spirit, despite periodic economic downturns in the
                    sugar industry. Throughout the week, people from all over the Visayas, flock to the town plaza. They join Bacoleños in the non-stop round of festivities. Even if you don't feel like dancing and singing, the pig catching and pole climbing
                    competitions are musts. Some are also trying their luck and testing their skills in mask-making contests, disco king and queen competitions, coconut-milk drinking to name a few.</p>

                <div>Masks are the order of the day at the Masskara parade, as brightly-costumed men and women dance and prance in the streets. Their beaming faces are be-dimpled, grinning and laughing in molded clay or papier-mache. Every group is represented:
                    civic associations, commercial establishments, schools, even private and government organizations. They march out in enthusiastic throngs wearing their painted masks and elaborate costumes, all vying for prizes in judging that will
                    be held in the afternoon. The festival also benefits Bacolod tourism not only because tourists flock the city during this time to join the merrymaking but also to buy the orchids and ornate handicrafts on sale.</div><br>

                <h3>Sinulog Festival</h3>
                <p>For 32 years, the Sinulog Festival is a traditional celebration in Cebu City held every third Sunday of January to honor the Santo Niño (Child Jesus). Basically, the festival is done by a dance ritual, in which it tells the story of the
                    Filipino people’s pagan past and their acceptance of Christianity. The word “Sinulog” means “graceful dance”, wherein it all started in 1980 with a simple dance that represents the “sulog” (or current) of a river in Cebu. With the
                    celebration’s evolution, the Sinulog Festival has become a month long tradition in Cebu. The most-awaited feature, nevertheless, is the Sinulog Grand Parade which was held on the 15th day of January. “One Beat, One Dance, One Vision.
                    Cebu – City of Culture” was the theme adopted for the 2012 Sinulog Festival.</p>
                <div>As the festival becomes more and more famous each year, tourists would never want to miss the opportunity to watch it and became more and more commercialized. The festival now, not only consists of costumes and dances, but also contests,
                    such as art exhibits, beauty pageants, photo contests, and singing and dancing contests. Participants may also join the festival’s activities, such as concerts, cultural shows, fireworks display, fun runs, and street fairs. For the
                    past 18 years, it has made the Filipinos residing in New Zealand celebrate their own version each year, a proof on how big of an influence the festival is. It has also been recognized as the “City of Culture” by the Association of
                    Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</div><br>
